# ZT DNS Companion

* * *

## About

This tool allows you to query your [ZeroTier](https://zerotier.com) networks and create per-interface DNS settings for name resolution. Whether you use a managed or self hosted controller, you can configure at the controller level [custom DNS server and search domain](https://docs.zerotier.com/dns-management) downstream to the client. Windows, MacOS, Android, and IOS all have the capability of auto configuring their systems to utilize this setting. If you are running a Linux host, you need to perform extra configuration, due to the many types of network tools avaialable. This utility aims to automate that work.

This tool supports using:

## Prerequisites and Assumptions

* Assumes you are have the Zerotier-One client installed and are connected to one or more networks
* An available DNS server to serve records
* Utilizing either:
  * `systemd-networkd`, a system service that manages network configurations, primarily for servers and headless Linux systems.
  * `systemd-resolved` which is a system service that provides network name resolution for local applications on Linux systems. It works alongside [NetworkManager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NetworkManager#systemd-resolved), [ConnMan](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ConnMan#Using_systemd-resolved) and [`iwd`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd#Select_DNS_manager) and others making this suitable for those using desktop Linux. This mode requires `resolvectl` to be available on the system.

## Configuration

### Quick Start

### Configuration File

ZT DNS Companion supports a configuration file to simplify managing options. By default, it looks for a configuration file at `/etc/zt-dns-companion.conf`. You can also specify a custom configuration file using the `--config` command-line argument.

#### How It Works

1. **Default Configuration File**:
   - If `/etc/zt-dns-companion.conf` exists, it will be loaded automatically.
   - Command-line arguments override values from the configuration file.

2. **Custom Configuration File**:
   - Use the `--config` argument to specify a custom configuration file.
   - If the specified file does not exist, it will be created with default values, and the program will notify you.

3. **Command-Line Overrides**:
   - Any options provided via command-line arguments will take precedence over the configuration file.

#### Example Configuration File

An [example configuration file](contrib/config/zt-dns-companion.conf) is provided. You can copy it to `/etc/zt-dns-companion.conf` or use it as a reference for creating a custom configuration file.

```json
{
  "add_reverse_domains": false,
  "auto_restart": true,
  "dns_over_tls": false,
  "dry_run": false,
  "host": "http://localhost",
  "log_level": "info",
  "mode": "networkd",
  "multicast_dns": false,
  "port": 9993,
  "reconcile": true,
  "token_file": "/var/lib/zerotier-one/authtoken.secret",
  "token": ""
}
```

#### Using a Custom Configuration File

To use a custom configuration file, pass the `--config` argument:

```bash
zt-dns-companion --config /path/to/custom-config.json
```

If the specified file does not exist, it will be created with default values, and you will see a message indicating that the file has been autogenerated.

## Usage

This should be run as a systemd service and timer as it only bases its information of present moment. It will not monitor if you change DNS server settings on your controller, and if using `resolved` mode will not survive a reboot. See [systemd](systemd) for examples of units and timers that can be implemented into your distribution.

Run `zerotier-systemd-manager` as `root` with appropriate command line arguments. If you are connected to ZeroTier networks which have DNS assignments depending on which `-mode` you are running it will:

* `networkd` - Populate files in `/etc/systemd/network/99-<network-name>` . It will then restart `systemd-networkd` for you if things have changed.
* `resolved` - Populate search domains and dns server entries with `resolvectl` if entries don't already exist.

### Command Line Arguments

To change the way the tool operates, you can pass various arguments via the command line.

* `-config`: Specify a custom configuration file. If the file does not exist, it will be autogenerated with default values and any other command-line arguments passed to the binary.
* `-mode`: Set the mode of operation (`networkd` or `resolved`) (default: `networkd`).
* `-log-level`: Set the logging level (`info` or `debug`).
* `-dry-run`: Simulate changes without applying them.
* `-auto-restart`: (networkd) Automatically restart `systemd-networkd` when changes are detected (default: true).
* `-reconcile`: (networkd) Remove unused network files when networks are no longer active (default: true).
* `-dns-over-tls`: Enable DNS-over-TLS for supported configurations (default: false).
* `-multicast-dns`: Enable multicast DNS (mDNS) for ZeroTier interfaces (default: false).
* `-add-reverse-domains`: Add reverse DNS search domains (e.g., `in-addr.arpa`, `ip6.arpa`) based on assigned IPs (default: false).
